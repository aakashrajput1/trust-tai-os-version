# SLA Notification Fix - Support Lead Dashboard

## üêõ Problem Description

The Support Lead Dashboard was experiencing a notification loop issue where SLA warnings for the same ticket (e.g., TK-2024-004) were being displayed repeatedly every minute, causing:

- Multiple identical notifications
- User confusion and frustration
- Potential performance issues
- Poor user experience

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Notification Deduplication System

**At the Dashboard Level:**
- Added `notifiedTickets` state to track which tickets have already triggered notifications
- Each ticket can only trigger one notification per session
- Notifications are automatically reset when SLA warnings change

**At the Provider Level:**
- Enhanced `SimpleNotificationProvider` with duplicate detection
- Prevents notifications with identical title/message within 5 minutes
- Automatic cleanup of old notifications (older than 1 hour)

### 2. Improved SLA Checking Logic

- Added validation for `timeLeft` values to prevent errors
- Better error handling with try-catch blocks
- More granular notification levels (warning, critical, breached)
- Automatic notification state management

### 3. Enhanced User Controls

- **Refresh Button**: Manually reset all notifications
- **SLA Refresh Button**: Reset only SLA-related notifications
- **Notification Management Panel**: View and control notification state
- **Clear All Button**: Remove all notification history

## üöÄ How to Use

### Automatic Operation
The system now works automatically without user intervention:
1. SLA warnings are checked every minute
2. Each ticket triggers only one notification per session
3. Notifications are automatically cleaned up

### Manual Controls
Users can manually manage notifications:

1. **Refresh Dashboard**: Resets all notifications and reloads data
2. **Refresh SLA Warnings**: Resets only SLA notifications
3. **Clear All Notifications**: Removes all notification history
4. **View Notification Status**: See which tickets have been notified

### Notification Management Panel
Located below SLA warnings, this panel shows:
- Current notification count
- List of recently notified tickets
- System behavior explanation
- Manual control buttons

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Key Components Modified

1. **`src/app/dashboard/support-lead/page.tsx`**
   - Added `notifiedTickets` state
   - Enhanced SLA checking logic
   - Added notification management UI
   - Improved error handling

2. **`src/components/ui/SimpleNotificationProvider.tsx`**
   - Added duplicate detection
   - Implemented time-based deduplication
   - Added automatic cleanup
   - Enhanced notification filtering

### State Management

```typescript
const [notifiedTickets, setNotifiedTickets] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
```

- Tracks which tickets have triggered notifications
- Prevents duplicate notifications
- Automatically resets when needed

### Notification Flow

1. **Check SLA Status** (every minute)
2. **Validate Ticket** (check if already notified)
3. **Send Notification** (if eligible)
4. **Mark as Notified** (prevent duplicates)
5. **Clean Up** (remove old notifications)

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Verification Steps

1. **Load Dashboard**: Check that SLA warnings appear
2. **Wait 1 Minute**: Verify no duplicate notifications
3. **Check Console**: Look for debug information (development mode)
4. **Use Refresh**: Test manual notification reset
5. **Monitor Notifications**: Ensure proper deduplication

### Expected Behavior

- ‚úÖ Each ticket triggers only one notification
- ‚úÖ No duplicate warnings for the same ticket
- ‚úÖ Notifications can be manually reset
- ‚úÖ System handles errors gracefully
- ‚úÖ Performance remains optimal

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If Issues Persist

1. **Check Console**: Look for error messages
2. **Verify State**: Check `notifiedTickets` in React DevTools
3. **Refresh Dashboard**: Use manual refresh button
4. **Clear Notifications**: Use "Clear All" button
5. **Check Network**: Ensure API calls are working

### Common Issues

- **Notifications still duplicating**: Check if `notifiedTickets` state is working
- **Performance issues**: Verify cleanup intervals are running
- **Missing notifications**: Check notification provider setup
- **State not resetting**: Ensure dependency arrays are correct

## üìà Performance Improvements

- **Reduced Notification Spam**: Eliminates duplicate notifications
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes old notifications automatically
- **Efficient State Management**: Uses Set for fast lookups
- **Optimized Intervals**: Proper cleanup of timers

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **Persistent Notification State**: Save across browser sessions
- **Custom Notification Rules**: User-configurable thresholds
- **Notification History**: Archive and search past notifications
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter notifications by type, priority, etc.
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates

## üìù Summary

This fix resolves the SLA notification loop issue by implementing a comprehensive deduplication system at multiple levels. The solution provides both automatic operation and manual controls, ensuring a smooth user experience while maintaining system reliability.

The implementation follows React best practices and includes proper error handling, performance optimization, and user-friendly controls for managing the notification system.
